You need to be aware of the environment you are making your application for because
it influences the design and tools you need to use to accomplish your goals.

Consider if you wanted to build a vehicle that could transport you from one point to another. 
The primary question that will influence how you would build the vehicle is:
"what is the environment?"

Building a vehicle for travel in the ocean would surely be different than a vehicle built for land.
The tools you would use would change; you might use a sail rather than wheels.

Software works in the same way. You use different tools based on different environments.    
**Computer languages, design patterns, and databases are just tools.** A good programmer will pick the best tools suited for the task at hand.

So if you are trying to build an android app you should learn the way the android app platform works
and what tools are available to you to accomplish your goals.
