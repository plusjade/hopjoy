### What is the Web?

The web or internet is a network of interconnected computers. It is of course a bit more complicated than that
but it is no less true that when what we know as the internet is just a collection of computers all connected to one another.

### What is an Application?

An application is a computer software program designed for the _user_ to perform a task.
Some software programs do not interface with the user at all, such as internal systems programs. you may never see or use these programs.
  
However an application is intended for the user.
A web-based application is an application that can be used over the internet using various web-technologies.

You already use lots of web-based applications. They can run on a wide range of devices:
  
- Web Browsers
- Mobile phones
- Ipad


### What is an Application Environment?

A an application environment is the medium in which the user interacts with the web-application.
If you are on a standard PC/MAC you likely use a _web browser_ as the interface to web applications.
Mobile phones have web browsers too but they also have "native apps".
A native app on a phone uses the phone itself (its operating system software) as the interface.
The ipad also has a browser as well as native apps that use the ipad system as an interace.

Interfaces are important because you need to build your web-app in a way that the interface can understand.
That is to say you have to build your web app specifically for each interface.

For this lesson we will focus on developing a web-application that interfaces with a Web Browser.
