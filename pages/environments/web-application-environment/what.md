A web application environment is the medium in which a user experiences a web application.
One example of a web application is the website http://google.com.
When you use http://google.com you typically use it through a program called a _web browser_.
The _web browser_ is the application environment - the medium - in which you experience the http://google.com web application.

Let's break down what we mean when we say _the web_ and an _application_.

### What is the Web?

The web or internet is a network of interconnected computers. At its simplest definition,
what we know as the Internet is really just a collection of computers all connected to one another.
Your computer, my computer, massive computers at Google and Amazon, we all make up _The Internet_.

### What is an Application?

An application is a computer software program designed for the _user_ to perform a task.
Some software programs do not interface with the user at all, such as internal systems programs. you may never see or use these programs.
  
However an application is intended for the user.
A web-based application is an application that can be used over the internet using various web-technologies.
