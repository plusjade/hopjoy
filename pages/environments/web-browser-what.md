A web browser is a software program that allows you to access and retrieve content from the Internet
on your computer. The content is made available on the internet by means of a URL a type of address for content.
Once the browser receives the content from the URL it formats it in a nice way for human's to use and understand.

Web browsers today run on many different devices such as laptops, desktops, smartphones, and ipads.
A web browser fetches content such as text, code, images, audio files, and pdfs from the Internet based on
the URL you give it. 

A URL or Unique Resource Location is the way we know where to find things on the Internet.
This is what we mean when we say _a website's web address_.

The main part of the URL is the TLD or Top Level Domain Name. It's the part
that comes before any slash marks `/` 

    In the web address "http://www.google.com/q/something?query=hello"
    www.google.com is the TLD.
